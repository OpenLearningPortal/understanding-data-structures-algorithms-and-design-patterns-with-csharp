# Understand data structures,algorithms and design patterns using CSharp


Welcome to  step by step learning process " Understanding data structures,algorithms and design patterns using c#"

This is a minimalistic and straight to the point guide on understanding two different but related topics using csharp language.This requires some general progamming knowledge and csharp basics.


## Design Patterns

This guide focuses on implementing many data structures(HashTable,Dictionary,ArrayList,Stack,Queue etc)  you use most and then go on to exploring algorithms with those data structures.Then we look at the Design patterns aspect as well covering most generic degin patterns yo use in your day to day job (may be without you realising that you are using it :) .

Note: This guide is organized as three main sections and sub sections under it.You can follow these three sections seperately and order is not important.

The code of this tutorial works on Linux,macOS and Windows
